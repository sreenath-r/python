python is mainly used for backend development, where it handles server-side logic, databases, APIs, 
and application processing.

python can be used for frontend development in desktop applications (using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt), it is not 
typically used for web frontend(browser based UI), which relies on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
