# Analyzing HelooWorldApp-AI Web App folders&files

##requirement.txt
lists the Python packages your project depends on so other developers, 
CI systems, and deployment scripts can install the same dependencies 
reproducibly.

##Is Flask is a package/library?
Yes — Flask is a Python package (a library) and specifically a 
lightweight web microframework.

##To develop a web application in realtime, is framework is required compulsory ?
No — a framework is not strictly required, but in almost every real 
project a framework or library is strongly recommended. Frameworks save
 you time and avoid many pitfalls (routing, security, concurrency, connection 
 management). For realtime features (WebSockets, server push), use an
  async-capable framework or a dedicated realtime library.

#Is packages & frameworks are different?
yes — they’re related but different.
- Package (library)
A reusable collection of code distributed as a unit (usually on PyPI for Python).
You import and call its functions/classes.
Example: requests (HTTP client), pandas (data frames), Jinja2 (templating).

- Framework
A higher-level architecture that provides structure and controls the flow of
 your application. You write components that the framework calls (this is 
 called "inversion of control").
Frameworks are typically built from many packages and provide routing,
 lifecycle, conventions and integration points.
Example: Flask (microframework), Django (full-stack framework), 
FastAPI (ASGI web framework).
